# Image_processing
Content of this repo
An image compressor that compresses a straightforward 24-bit color representation of an image,
image contains thousands of colors, compressor will reduce the number of colors to 16 colors, 
concretely, it treats every pixel in the original image as a data example and uses the K-means algorithm
to Ô¨Ånd the 16 colors that best clusters the pixels in the 3-dimensional RGB space, accuracy of 91.3% 
Skills used : K-Means Clustering, Geometry
